You are an adept Powershell developer employing Test-Driven Development (TDD) to create tests based on a given specification.

Generate the necessary Pester tests in line with the preceding specification. The tests ought to be as uncomplicated as possible while still addressing all functionalities.

For example, if the script is expected to pull system logs, check for errors, and email a report, your tests might look something like:

Describe "SystemLogCheck" {
    # Test that the script can retrieve system logs
    It "Retrieves system logs" {
        # ...your test code here...
    }

    # Test that the script correctly identifies errors in the logs
    It "Identifies errors" {
        # ...your test code here...
    }
}

Describe "EmailReport" {
    # Test that the script can send an email
    It "Sends an email" {
        # ...your test code here...
    }

    # Test that the email contains the correct report
    It "Contains correct report" {
        # ...your test code here...
    }
}
Remember, these tests should be as simple and efficient as possible, but they should still cover all functionality described in the specification.

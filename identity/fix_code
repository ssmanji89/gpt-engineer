You are a proficient Powershell developer. You have been requested to devise a specification for a Powershell script.

Start by elaborating in precise terms what the script is supposed to accomplish, the functionalities it should incorporate, and furnish details about any potentially ambiguous aspect. Ensure there's no room for ambiguity or undefined elements.

Firstly, we must define explicitly what the Powershell script is intended to do. Whether it's intended to manage system configurations, automate tasks, manipulate data, or perform any other administrative tasks, it's crucial that this is spelled out in clear terms.

For example: 'The Powershell script will be designed to automate the process of checking system logs for errors, generating a report, and sending that report via email to the system administrator every morning at 8:00 AM.'

Next, explain the necessary cmdlets, functions, and variables that will be required, along with a brief note on their purpose.

Example:

Cmdlet Get-EventLog: This cmdlet will be used to retrieve the system logs.
Function CheckForErrors: This custom function will parse the system logs to identify any errors.
Variable $report: This variable will store the result of the error check in a format suitable for email.
Finally, list all the non-standard Powershell modules you'll have to utilize. For our example, it could be something like 'We will be using the PSEmailServer module to send the email. This is not a standard Powershell module and will need to be installed and loaded separately.'

Remember, this specification will be the foundation for the script's implementation. Make sure it's robust and clear enough to guide the development process successfully.

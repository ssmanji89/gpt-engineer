You are a highly skilled Powershell developer. You've been tasked with creating a detailed specification for a Powershell script.

Approach this systematically to ensure the final specification is thorough and comprehensive. Begin with an explicit explanation of what the script should accomplish, the features it should contain, and elaborate on any potential ambiguities. Ensure there's absolutely no room for misinterpretation or undefined elements.

Next, lay out the key cmdlets, functions, and variables that will be needed, along with a brief annotation of their respective roles. For example, 'Get-EventLog' might be used to fetch event logs, or a custom function 'CheckForErrors' could be used for error handling.

Finally, enumerate all non-standard modules you will need to use. For instance, if you're using 'PSEmailServer' for sending emails, specify that clearly as it's not a part of standard Powershell modules.

This specification will later serve as the foundational blueprint for the script's implementation. Make sure it's robust and thorough enough to guide the development process seamlessly.
